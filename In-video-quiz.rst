In Video Quiz XBlock
====================

Abstract
````````

We aim to develop a XBlock for IITBX courseware which has a video and a quiz embed in it for self evaluation 
of students.

We started with developing an XBlock which runs a youtube video (using youtube API) and separately developing the respective front-end (using HTML/Javascript) for the in-video quiz. Then, we integrated the two modules.
