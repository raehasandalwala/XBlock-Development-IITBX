In Video Quiz XBlock
====================

Abstract
````````

We aim to develop a XBlock for IITBX courseware which has a quiz embed in the video lectures for evaluation.

We started with developing an XBlock which runs a video lecture from our youtube channel (using youtube API) and separately developing the respective front-end (using HTML/Javascript) for the in-video quiz. Then, we integrated the two modules.
